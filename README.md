## Overview
The katas are present in the `master` branch in form of unit tests. You may want to use these tests as a starting point,
or you can opt for the TDD way, writing the tests one after the other and just using the kata description as a starting point.
If you choose to do that, I recommend that you do not look at the existing tests as to not taint your mind.

Solutions are present in the `solutions` branch. Of course, these are my solutions and by no means represent the sole (or best) option possible.

## The Katas
* [Fizz Buzz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) - write a program that given a number, returns 'fizz', 'buzz', 'fizzbuzz' or the original number according to the Fizz Buzz rules. Use functional programming and be as DRY as possible.
* [Fibonacci](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) - write a recursive function to calculate the Fibonacci number for a given `n`. Try to optimize using memoization, tail call recursion or Scala Streams.
* [Magic Square](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_square) - write a program that generates a valid 3x3 magic square. Try to use declarative or logic programming principles. 
* [Roman Numerals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals) - write a recursive function to generate a Roman Numeral representation for a given number.
* [Towers Of Hanoi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi) - write a program that generates a series of moves to solve the Towers of Hanoi for any `n` discs using 3 poles.
* [Berlin Clock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mengenlehreuhr) - use functional programming to generate the Mengenlehreuhr representation for a given instant.
