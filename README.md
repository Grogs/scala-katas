Scala Katas and their solutions, initially based on the list from http://technologyconversations.com/2014/03/10/scala-tutorial-through-katas/

## Overview
The katas are present in the `master` branch in form of unit tests. You may want to use these tests as a starting point,
or you can opt for the TDD way, writing the tests one after the other and just using the kata description as a starting point.
If you choose to do that, I recommend that you do not look at the existing tests as to not taint your mind.

## The Katas
* Fizz Buzz
* Fibonacci
* Magic Square
* Roman Numerals
* Towers Of Hanoi
* Berlin Clock
